# Experiment 3 - An autonomous pattern generator that will create a rich visual effect that is different each time it is run.

## Brief
When I thought about the pattern, I recalled how I learned to make animations in After Effects, and then I was inspired by simple animated tiled patterns. And I thought I can make a similar pattern in p5.js.

My idea was that the canvas is divided into cells, forming a virtual grid. Next, an object is created that fills each cell. Then, an animation is performed in which the elements undergo a small transformation or movement, and we see an interesting visual result. I can already assume that I will use a two-dimensional array (matrix) to store the pattern elements and use loops to fill the grid with elements. I will apply randomness to some of the element's properties so that I can get a unique outcome each time.
